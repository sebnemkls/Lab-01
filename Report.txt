Using GitHub and GitKraken makes teamwork much easier. Especially when we work different hours. 
It makes it easy to work, track, and collaborate at any time of day.
Also, there is no confusion about files because we do not have too many slightly different files after we change other programs. 
Additionally, even though we did not use it in this assignment comments on GitHub will be too useful on bigger programs like our project. 
Still, I encountered some obstacles especially when using GitKraken. 
One of them is its interface. I almost pushed files wrongly a couple of times. 
So, it requires a lot of attention when using it. It was hard to understandbranch and main relationship and using it.
